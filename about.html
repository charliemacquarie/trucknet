        <p class="highlight">Trucknet is the on-board network for the Library of Approximate Location. It's a network, but not the internet. It's a small server that lives inside the Library truck, and you connect via wifi to access digital materials in the Library. If you are connected to this now, it probably means we're on a trip together. Thanks for coming!

        <p class="highlight">The Library of Approximate Location is an ongoing itinerant project installing site-specific, small scale libraries at locations around the western half of the so-called United States of America. Taking as its starting point the often terrible reality of this landscape as a vast, techno-industrial megastructure, this library proposes alternative networks, supply chains, resource management practices. What might happen if we diversify our value systems to reflect family histories, emotional landscapes, indigenous sovereignty, or an aesthetic of the commons? Operating on an alternative logic, and claiming physical space for sharing and non-monetized transaction, the library becomes the ideal site to speculate critically about restructuring the terms of exchange around resource extraction and a networked world.
